# How to Start Contributing to Project Nebulus!

## Step 1: Get the IDEs
1) Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students and make a new application. If you already have the [GitHub developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack), you may choose the GitHub tab. This will give you premium for all JetBrains IDEs.
2) Wait for an email from `JetBrains Sales` with an email titled `License Certificate for your JetBrains Educational Pack`. Give it 2 minutes, if its not there wait another 2 minutes. It's usually very quick!
3) Download required Nebulus IDEs. `PyCharm Professional` (Don't get `PyCharm CE/Community Edition`), `WebStorm`, `DataGrip`. Optional IDEs include `IntelliJ Ultimate` and `CLion`
