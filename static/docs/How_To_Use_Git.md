# How to Start Contributing to Project Nebulus!

## Step 1: Get the IDEs
1) Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students and make a new application. If you already have the GitHub developer pack, you may choose the GitHub tab. This will give you premium for all JetBrains IDEs.
2) Wait for an email from `JetBrains Sales` with an email titled `License Certificate for your JetBrains Educational Pack`. Give it 2 minutes, if its not there wait another 2 minutes. It's usually very quick!
3) Download required Nebulus IDEs. `PyCharm Professional` (Don't get `PyCharm CE/Community Edition`), `WebStorm`, `DataGrip`. Optional IDEs include `IntelliJ Ultimate` and `CLion`
