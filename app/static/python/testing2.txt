Visualization
Wouldn’t itfdrfgf be nice if we could visualize, at a glance, whether and how much a text was plagiarized? To do this, we can represent a student submission as a heatmap image where each pixel corresponds to the score of one word. This allows us to quickly gauge if plagiarism is likely, and which parts of a text were most likely to have been plagiarized. Visualizing information in this way is more useful that looking at an array of numerical scores or a summary statistic of all the scores.

I playfdfded around with varioffgfgus ways of visualizing this data, and I came up with the following method:
fgf
Display K words per line (I used K=8). This is the heatmap width in pixels. Then calculate the height (number of words in testing data divided by K).
Due to the small size of the datasegfdcvt and the challenges of interpolation, there is some uncertainty in the assigned scores, so I applied Gaussian smoothing to the scores.
Reshape the arrayhtrgbt of scores into a rectaffgffngle of K columns and height rows. This requires adding zero padding to ensure the array is the correct size.
Use Plotly Heatmap to show the image using the colorscale of your choice.
Show the K words of text as a y-axis tick label next to the corresponding row of the heatmap for easy side-by-side comparison. Adjust the hover data so that each pixel shows its corresponding word on hover.
