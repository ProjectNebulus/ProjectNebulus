What does one think when they hear the word “Napoleon?” One would usually think that Napoleon was a monarch of France. However, Napoleon was not only significant to France when he was an emperor. He was also substantial to France before he was an emperor. Napoleon is the most crucial figure because he was an important general in the French Revolution. He also heavily influenced the French Revolution, and without him, the French Revolution would have been very different. Napoleon's significance impacted all stages of the French Revolution: his early life, his life during the Republic, and his life as an Emperor.

	His early life is significant because his early life heavily influenced his later life. If his childhood had been different, his personality would have been dramatically different, thus impacting his future life decisions. Napoleon was “born in Ajaccio, on the French island of Corsica, on August 15, 1769.” This is shocking because he was a French monarch who wasn’t from mainland France! This proves that Napoleon would have to be very talented in order to serve high offices in the French government. Later in his childhood, Napoleon ended up at the military college of Brienne, where he studied for five years, before moving on to the military academy in Paris. In 1785, while Napoleon was at the academy, his father died of stomach cancer. This propelled Napoleon to take the reins as the head of the family. Graduating early from the military academy, Napoleon, now second lieutenant of artillery, returned to Corsica in 1786.”   This education might be the reason that leads to Napolean winning many future wars. As you can see, without this childhood, Napoleon would have been very different.
	Napoleon has also been very important when he was in the Jacobin club and the Directory. Napoleon “at once joined the Jacobin Club, a debating society initially favouring a constitutional monarchy, and soon became its president, making speeches against nobles, monks, and bishops.” This shows he was very involved even before he was an emperor. Being the president of the Jacobins also makes him important because the Jacobins were an important club of the National Assembly. This is significant because he must have a lot of influence to get to be the president of the Jacobins. He was also a  “commander of the Army of the Interior and, consequently, was henceforth aware of every political development in France. He became the respected adviser on military matters to the new government, the Directory,” Napoleon was also involved during the time where the Directory was the French government. This tells us Napolean was very involved in French politics because he had an important position in all time periods of the French government. He helped the Directory win many wars. He also made many unbelievable achievements such as conqauering all of Italy in 2 months. To conclude, Napoleon is important because he was involved in many political governments such as the Jacobin club and the Directory.

	Finally, Napoleon is also significant for being the first Emperor of France. Then, “in 1802, a constitutional amendment made Napoleon first consul for life. Two years later, in 1804, he crowned himself emperor of France in a lavish ceremony at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.” This is important because he essentially created his own government. He also, “achieved what is considered to be one of his greatest victories at the Battle of Austerlitz, in which his army defeated the Austrians and Russians. The victory resulted in the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine.”  Napoleon is very significant for being the first emperor of France. He must be very popular and smart in order to overthrow a whole government. Not many people in history have done that. Also, in order to be in charge, the citizens have to like you or your ideas. As you can see, Napoleon was very crucial for being the first Emperor of France.

Napoleon is the most important French figure of all the politicians of France. He has greatly impacted France and without him, France would have been very different!
